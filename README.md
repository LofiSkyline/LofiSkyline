- 🛠️ I'm passionate about building AI-driven products, especially focusing on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and knowledge graph technologies.
- 🎵 Music is a vital part of my life — I'm deeply into jazz, hip-hop, and lofi beats.
- 📺 I'm a big fan of Shinichirō Watanabe's anime like *Cowboy Bebop* and *Samurai Champloo*, fascinated by the romantic spirit of the early 2000s.
- 🏸 I love sports, and badminton is an irreplaceable part of my daily life.
- 🌈 I’m LofiSkyline. Nice to meet you! No matter where the future takes us, I hope there’s always a beautiful blue sky above.
